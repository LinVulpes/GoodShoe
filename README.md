# Web-Programming
Build a full-stack web application where users can browse, search, and buy shoes.

StepUp is a modern online store for sport shoes, built using ASP .NET Core and Bootstrap. 
The purpose of this project is to recreate a real-world online shopping website designed to showcase and sell sport shoes online. 
The platform is designed mainly for customers of both genders with a focus on athletes and everyday users. 
Users can browse, search, and filter shoes by brand, size or price while allowing viewing products and purchasing them online.  
Users can also track their purchases through an order history page, and maintain a profile to personalize their experience.
